VISION PC (on board)
=========

hostname: walkman-vision-pc
IP address: 10.24.3.101

user: vision
pass: vision

How to access: 

ssh -X vision@10.24.3.101

Open 4 terminals in the walkman-vision-pc:

1) roscore
2) multisense (start the multisense ros driver)
3) dimi_grabber (start Dimitrios Kanoulas grabbers)
4) rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure (to change the multisense parameters)



CONTROL PC (on board)
==========

hostname: walkman-control-pc
IP address: 10.24.3.100

user: walkman
pass: walkman

How to access:

ssh -X walkman@10.24.3.100

Open 3 terminals in the walkman-vision-pc:

1) yarpserver --write
2) cd $WI 
   ./walkmainterface (first lunch: it will find 1 board [POWER BOARD] and starts the other boards then CTRL+C)  
   ./walkmainterface (second lunch: it will find 41 boards [ALL BOARDS] give enter every times to start the control on each chain of the robot)

3) encoder_publisher

If you need it, you can open other terminals to have one of the following features:

* Force-Torque ROS publisher (run 2 terminals):
  1. ft_ros_publisher
  2. yarp write ... /ft_ros_publisher/switch:i
    >> start

  It will publish the ft as ROS topic at 100hz

* YARP robot motor GUI (run 1 terminal)
  1. cd ~
     yarpmotorgui --direct
 
* Start the perception/control module that you need: take care to start only one control module at a time.

* start IMU independently from the walkmaninterface

  1. walkmanmodexe --device inertial --subdevice lpms_imu --imu_id A5022WEY 

PILOT PC
========

hostname: walkman-pilot-pc
IP address: 10.24.3.77 

user: lucamuratore
pass: lucamuratore

How to access:

Turn on the PC inside the rack.

Check that we are inside the same YARP network (using yarp detect), otherwise in a terminal write:

yarp conf 10.24.3.100 10000

Open 3 terminals in the walkman-pilot-pc:

1) encoder_subscriber
2) roslaunch walkman_launch state_publisher.launch
3) roslaunch pilot_interface PI_walkman.launch config:=drc
